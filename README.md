## CrimeSpottinghttps

An app to track crimes within a choosen area and filter it by data and type of crime.

- GoogleMaps API
- data.police.uk API

## Key learning to practise and/or revise:

 - Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
  - Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
   - Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it

## Task:

Practise what have done this week using JavaScript in the browser:

Fetch information from an API.
Display/Analyse the information in the browser - using DOM manipulation/Charts/Maps/Canvas etc. Be creative! If you want to focus on Maps / Canvas without getting outside data from an API that's fine, revise the HTTP requests to make sure I am confident with them.
